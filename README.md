### 1) Selection Sort

Selection sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. In each iteration, it picks the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and places it at the correct position in the sorted part. This is similar to sorting a deck of cards in order: we start with the smallest and proceed to the largest.

**General Selection Sort Logic:**
1. Start from the first element and search the entire array to find the minimum element.
2. Swap the minimum element with the first element.
3. Move to the next position and repeat the process for the remaining unsorted part.
4. Continue until the array is completely sorted.
