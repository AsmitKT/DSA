### 1) Selection Sort

Selection sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. In each iteration, it picks the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and places it at the correct position in the sorted part. This is similar to sorting a deck of cards in order: we start with the smallest and proceed to the largest.  
**Analogy:** Imagine picking the smallest apple from a pile and placing it in a new basket, repeating until all apples are sorted.

**General Selection Sort Logic (Pseudocode):**
```plaintext
// A is the array to be sorted
for j = 2 to A.length
    key = A[j]
    // Insert A[j] into the sorted sequence A[1...j-1]
    i = j-1
    while i > 0 and A[i] > key
        A[i+1] = A[i]
        i = i-1
    A[i+1] = key
```

### 2) Bubble Sort

Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.  
**Analogy:** Think of bubbles rising to the surface in water; the largest bubble (number) "bubbles up" to the top with each pass.

**General Bubble Sort Logic (Pseudocode):**
```plaintext
// A is the array to be sorted
for i = 0 to A.length - 1
    for j = 0 to A.length - i - 2
        if A[j] > A[j+1]
            swap A[j] and A[j+1]
```

### 3) Insertion Sort

Insertion sort builds the sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into its correct position among the previously sorted elements. This is also like sorting a deck of cards, but we can move only one card at a time until it gets placed at the correct position.  
**Analogy:** Like sorting books on a shelf one by one, picking each new book and sliding it into its correct spot among the already sorted books.

**General Insertion Sort Logic (Pseudocode):**
```plaintext
// A is the array to be sorted
for i = 1 to A.length - 1
    key = A[i]
    j = i - 1
    while j >= 0 and A[j] > key
        A[j+1] = A[j]
        j = j - 1
    A[j+1] = key
```

### 4) Merge Sort

Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the sorted array.  
**Analogy:** Like organizing a stack of papers by splitting them into smaller piles, sorting each pile, and then merging the piles back together in order.

**General Merge Sort Logic (Pseudocode):**
```plaintext
function mergeSort(A, left, right)
    if left < right
        mid = (left + right) / 2
        mergeSort(A, left, mid)
        mergeSort(A, mid+1, right)
        merge(A, left, mid, right)

function merge(A, left, mid, right)
    // Create temp arrays L and R
    // Copy data to temp arrays L[] and R[]
    // Merge the temp arrays back into A[left..right]
    // Copy any remaining elements of L[] and R[]
```

### 5) Quick Sort

Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array around the pivot, sorting the partitions recursively.  
**Analogy:** Like organizing shoes by picking one shoe as a reference (pivot), putting all smaller sizes to one side and larger to the other, then repeating for each side.

**General Quick Sort Logic (Pseudocode):**
```plaintext
function quickSort(A, low, high)
    if low < high
        pi = partition(A, low, high)
        quickSort(A, low, pi - 1)
        quickSort(A, pi + 1, high)

function partition(A, low, high)
    pivot = A[high]
    i = low - 1
    for j = low to high - 1
        if A[j] < pivot
            i = i + 1
            swap A[i] and A[j]
    swap A[i + 1] and A[high]
    return i + 1
```

### 6) Heap Sort

Heap sort converts the array into a heap data structure, then repeatedly extracts the maximum (for max-heap) or minimum (for min-heap) element from the heap and rebuilds the heap until the array is sorted. You can use either a max-heap (for ascending order) or a min-heap (for descending order). The heapify function maintains the heap property.  
**Analogy:** Like organizing a tournament where the winner (largest or smallest) is selected and removed each round, and the remaining players are re-seeded for the next round.

**General Heap Sort Logic (Pseudocode):**
```plaintext
// A is the array to be sorted
// For ascending order, use max-heap; for descending order, use min-heap

buildHeap(A) // buildMaxHeap or buildMinHeap depending on desired order
for i = A.length - 1 downto 1
    swap A[0] and A[i]
    heapify(A, 0, i) // maxHeapify or minHeapify as per heap type

function heapify(A, i, n)
    // For max-heap: ensure A[i] >= children
    // For min-heap: ensure A[i] <= children
    // Swap and recurse as needed to maintain heap property
```
